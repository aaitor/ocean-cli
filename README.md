## Features

Ocean Protocol Command Line tool allowing to interact with the Ocean stack

This library is under heavy development



### Running Ocean CLI

You can compile the application using the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This should generate the JAR package in the target folder. You can run the application using the usual way (`java -jar app.jar`). 
Also, setting up an alias would make quicker and easier to run the application:
```bash
alias ocean-cli="java -jar target/ocean-cli-*-shaded.jar"
```
