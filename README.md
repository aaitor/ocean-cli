## Features

Ocean Protocol Command Line tool allowing to interact with the Ocean stack

This library is under heavy development

### Compiling

You can compile the application using the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Ocean CLI requires Java 11.

### Installation

After compiling the application, you will see in the `target/` folder a zip file with the config files required.
Ocean CLI can setup the config files for you with the default parameters,
but you could also unzip the zip file into the `~/.local/share/ocean-cli` folder, e.g.

```bash
cd target
unzip ocean-cli-*.zip -d ~/.local/share/ocean-cli
```

The unzipped folder should have the following structure:

```bash
$ ls -la ~/.local/share/ocean-cli/
total 20
drwxrwxr-x  3 aitor aitor 4096 Mar 24 20:35 .
drwx------ 55 aitor aitor 4096 Mar 24 20:35 ..
-rw-rw-r--  1 aitor aitor   17 Mar 23 18:39 application.conf
-rw-rw-r--  1 aitor aitor  449 Mar 24 20:33 log4j2.properties
drwxr-xr-x  2 aitor aitor 4096 Mar 24 20:34 networks

```

### Running Ocean CLI

This should generate the JAR package in the target folder. You can run the application using the usual way (`java -jar app.jar`). 
Also, setting up an alias would make quicker and easier to run the application:

```bash
alias ocean-cli='java $OCEAN_OPTS -jar target/ocean-cli-*-shaded.jar'
```

#### Connecting to a different network

All the parameters can be modified in the config files found in `~/.local/share/ocean-cli`. Also it's possible to setup the **OCEAN_OPTS** 
environment variable overriding the options by default.

For example, connecting to a different network is so simple as setting up the following environment variable and running again the ocean-cli:

```bash
export OCEAN_OPTS=" $OCEAN_OPTS -Dnetwork=nile"
``` 

#### Using a different logging config file

```bash
export OCEAN_OPTS=" $OCEAN_OPTS -Dlog4j.configurationFile=$HOME/.local/share/ocean-cli/log4j2.properties"
```
